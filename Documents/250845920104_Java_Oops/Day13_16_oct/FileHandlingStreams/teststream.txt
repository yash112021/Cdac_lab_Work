In Java, streams are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allow you to process collections of data in a functional and declarative way. A stream is essentially a sequence of elements that can be processed using various operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing. Streams are not data structures themselves; instead, they work on data sources like collections, arrays, or I/O channels.

Key Characteristics of Streams

Streams are not storage mechanisms. They do not hold data but operate on existing data sources. For example, you can create a stream from a List or an Array.

Streams are immutable. They do not modify the original data source but produce a new result based on the operations applied.

Streams support lazy evaluation. Intermediate operations (like filtering or mapping) are not executed until a terminal operation (like collecting or counting) is invoked. This makes streams efficient.

Streams can be parallelized. You can process large datasets in parallel using parallelStream() to take advantage of multi-core processors.

Streams are single-use. Once a stream is consumed (i.e., a terminal operation is performed), it cannot be reused.

Common Operations on Streams

Streams support two types of operations: intermediate and terminal.

Intermediate Operations

These operations transform a stream into another stream and are lazy, meaning they are not executed until a terminal operation is called. Examples include:

filter(): Filters elements based on a condition.

map(): Transforms each element in the stream.

sorted(): Sorts the elements.

distinct(): Removes duplicates.In Java, streams are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allow you to process collections of data in a functional and declarative way.
